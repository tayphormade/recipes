"Martha Sue Stroud of Clarksville, Texas prepares these rolls that are golden and crusty on the outside and sweet and tender on the inside. The easy-to-handle dough rises in the refrigerator overnight for added convenience."
INGREDIENTS: 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast (or 1 cup sourdough starter)
2 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees F), divided 1/2 cup shortening
1/2 cup sugar 1 egg 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 7 cups all-purpose flour
DIRECTIONS: 1. In a bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup water; set aside.
2. In a mixing bowl, cream shortening and sugar. Add egg, salt, 4 cups flour, yeast
mixture and remaining water; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining water; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.
3. Punch dough down and divide into thirds; shape each portion into 12 rolls in desired
shape. Place on greased baking sheets. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-14 minutes or until lightly browned.
